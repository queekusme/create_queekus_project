# create_queekus_project
Inspired by create react app, This project allows me too quickly bootstrap a project with my most common settings such as commander, dotenv and express

This is formatted for my own preferences, use at your own discretion,

PRs will probably not be accepted for templates however if you spot a bug in my generation code feel free to chuck a pr in for it.

This is still very much WIP, so again, use at your own discretion
